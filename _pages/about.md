I am a Data Scientist in Grab Singapore, optimizing operations and improving customer experiences.

I received my PhD from the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management (ISEM), National University of Singapore (NUS), as a recipient of the Presidentâ€™s Graduate Fellowship. My research interests are in the application of operations research techniques such as simulation and optimization.
